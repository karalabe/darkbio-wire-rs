//! Encrypted sessions over a duplex byte stream.
//!
//! COBS framing separates packets, the handshake establishes encryption
//! contexts, and sealing protects messages. Each [`Client`] or [`Server`] owns
//! its receive context and shares its send context with active sends.
//! [`Sender`] handles allow other threads to send into that session.
//!
//! Adapters implement standard byte I/O plus the deadline setters in [`Read`]
//! and [`Write`]. Each outgoing frame has one configurable budget covering
//! partial writes and flush. A timeout ends that send or handshake without
//! closing the byte stream. Established-session reads wait for data or adapter
//! shutdown, with no session timeout. Handshakes use one configurable deadline
//! on each side, defaulting to 5 s.
//!
//! The client writes reset and hello before draining stale replies, so adapters
//! need enough available buffering to accept that output without concurrent
//! client reads. Backpressure may fail an attempt; the caller can retry with a
//! fresh reset.
