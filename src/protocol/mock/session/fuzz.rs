//! Fuzz model turning arbitrary actions into session scripts with independently

//!
//! The model uses integer time and a ledger of operations. It never reads
//! session internals to decide which result, queued message or deadline to
//! expect.
//!
//! The fixture supplies requests and write results directly, so duplicate wire
//! IDs and transport failures that end a whole session belong to the connection
//! runner instead. Everything here stays on the simulated clock.
