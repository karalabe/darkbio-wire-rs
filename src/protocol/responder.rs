/// Handle for answering one incoming request through the session that received it.
///
/// The handler selects the success content, without a static request/response map.
/// This handle cannot keep its session open or address a replacement session.
///
/// Dropping an unanswered responder queues an `UNANSWERED` error without blocking
/// on I/O, using the session's current autoreply timeout.
/// Configure it with [`super::Session::set_autoreply_timeout`] or
/// [`super::Server::set_autoreply_timeout`]. If the session has closed, no reply
/// is queued.
///
/// A held responder counts toward the session's inbound request limit. Queuing a
/// reply keeps that slot until the writer takes it or the reply is discarded.
/// See [`super::Session::set_inbound_limits`].
///
/// Both [`Self::reply`] and [`Self::fail`] consume the responder, so it cannot
/// be reused:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0382
/// use darkbio_wire::protocol::{Responder, schema};
/// use std::time::Instant;
///
/// fn answer_twice(responder: Responder, deadline: Instant) {
///     let _ = responder.reply(schema::DeviceInfoResponse::default(), deadline);
///     let _ = responder.fail(schema::Error::new(0x100, "refused"), deadline);
/// }
/// ```
