//! Bidirectional requests over the transport, with pipelining and explicit sessions.
//!
//! A reader receives messages from each connection. Each session also has a writer
//! that sends queued messages and a deadline worker that times out operations.
//! Incoming requests and unread responses stay encoded until [`Session::recv`]
//! or [`Promise::wait`] takes them. Invalid payloads close their original
//! session when decoded.
//!
//! Each session limits accepted peer requests and buffered incoming bytes. Set
//! both with [`Session::set_inbound_limits`] or [`Server::set_inbound_limits`].
//! Exceeding a limit closes the session. The reader never waits for the application
//! to make room. These limits are local; no flow control is negotiated with the
//! peer. The outgoing queue has no capacity limit.
//!
//! The application opens a [`crate::transport::Stream`]; this layer constructs and
//! owns its transport. [`connect`] establishes one client session. [`Server`] owns
//! a persistent stream and accepts successive server sessions. Each [`Session`]
//! owns its receive queue and closes when dropped. Its [`Requester`] and
//! [`Responder`] handles always target that session, even after it closes and
//! another session connects.
//!
//! Both sides use the same handle types. Sessions exchange [`Message`], the union
//! of every body in the [`schema`]. The [`schema::host_to_ark::Content`] and
//! [`schema::ark_to_host::Content`] oneofs hold what each side may send. Convert
//! a received [`Message`] into the peer's oneof to dispatch on it exhaustively.
//! Callers select response types when waiting on [`Promise<Message>`]. A request
//! is refused with a [`schema::Error`], an application's own error type converting
//! into one through [`CodedError`]. A request whose content this build does not
//! know is refused as `UNKNOWN` by the session itself, so a newer peer learns what
//! an older one serves. A response of unknown content is malformed, no request
//! having asked for it.
//!
//! Requests and replies return promises without waiting for I/O. Their deadlines
//! include time in the outgoing queue, and waiting does not restart the timeout.
//! Transport write timeouts are independent, so a request can still reach the
//! peer after its promise expires. The reader and writer run independently of the
//! application, but the application must keep receiving and answering requests
//! while its own requests wait for replies. All waiting is blocking; no async
//! runtime is required. Every request expects a reply, including notifications.
//!
//! Closing a session fails its pending promises and discards queued messages.
//! Completed promises keep their results. A write already in progress may still
//! reach the peer.
